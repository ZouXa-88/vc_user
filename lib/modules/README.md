# Modules

## What is 'module'?

- If some functions do similar tasks or are called frequently from many places, I will group them into one class (or namely, module).

- A 'module' contains some functions that support the frontend to build UI or do related tasks efficiently.

- All values and functions (or you can say "attributes and methods" formally) in module are 'static', so they can be accessed directly; instantiating a module is forbidden.
